TODO. It's unusable right now anyway.

## Set-up
<!--- The tree view lists all the events supported by the autosplitter.
- Select (by checking the box) each event for which you would like the autosplitter to split.
  - Note: The autosplitter does NOT check against split names, so make sure to have only as many splits as selected events.-->
Same.
